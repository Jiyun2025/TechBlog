Why does a VAE include a KL divergence term in its loss function, and what does it enforce?

*
 to regularize the latent space. This term enforces that the learned latent distribution stays close to a predefined prior distribution, ensuring a smooth and continuous latent space that facilitates effective generative sampling.
What is the objective function of a GAN, and how does it reflect the adversarial nature of the model?

*
the discriminator and generator are engaged in a minimax game, where the success of one directly hinders the performance of the other, encapsulating the adversarial dynamics at the core of GANs.
What is the role of the forward and reverse diffusion processes in a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)?

*
The forward process gradually adds noise to the data, while the reverse process iteratively removes this noise to generate new samples from the learned data distribution.
