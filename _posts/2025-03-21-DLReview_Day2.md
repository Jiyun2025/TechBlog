## ðŸ¦¥ DLReview_Day2 : Generative AI for Images - 2


### Why does a VAE include a KL divergence term in its loss function, and what does it enforce?


### What is the objective function of a GAN, and how does it reflect the adversarial nature of the model?


### What is the role of the forward and reverse diffusion processes in a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)?


### Provide an example of an urban application of diffusion models.
