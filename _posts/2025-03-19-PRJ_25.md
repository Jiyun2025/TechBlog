#  A Motivating Expedition As a Data Scientiest/ Analyst 

This space is dedicated to reviewing and reinforcing key concepts from the Urban Computing & AI class. As an aspiring Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer, I aim to deepen my understanding of the topics covered in the course while applying them to real-world problems.

Through this review project, I plan to:

âœ… Strengthen my knowledge of urban computing, machine learning, and AI applications

âœ… Revisit essential theories, algorithms, and methodologies to solidify my foundation

âœ… Develop practical skills by implementing concepts through hands-on projects

âœ… Connect insights from the course to my broader career goals in AI-driven urban analytics

This initiative is more than just a reviewâ€”itâ€™s a structured ***learning journey to bridge academic concepts with practical problem-solving, ensuring a stronger grasp of AI and ML*** . ðŸš€
